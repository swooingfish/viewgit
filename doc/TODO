- allow extra PATHs to be given, for example for git-issues. Otherwise all
  extra executables have to be in system PATH.

- url rewriting?
- support weird stuff in filenames (\n etc)
	- use -z for ls-tree
- commit page: link commit ids to commits
- commit searching
	- grep: git grep

	- better result page

- summary: sort heads by modified date?
- prefix unvalidated values from browser with 'untrusted_'
- rewrite the git functions into a reusable class
- diff between arbitrary trees/commits
- commitdiff page: filename list has no action links
- commit support / uploading of bundles to be reviewed
- pagenav loses track of which branch/tag we are viewing
- checkout: generate git-update-server-info information on-the-fly if needed?
- full log page
